### Overview
This is a straightforward web-based Todo application designed to help you manage your daily tasks. It features the core functionalities of a todo list: adding new tasks, marking existing tasks as complete or incomplete, and deleting tasks. All your tasks are automatically saved in your browser's local storage, ensuring they persist even if you close and reopen the browser.

### Setup
To get this application running, no complex setup is required. It's a single-file application that works directly in your web browser.
1.  **Save the file:** Copy all the content provided (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) and save it into a file named `index.html`.
2.  **Open in browser:** Navigate to the saved `index.html` file and open it with any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

The application will load instantly, ready for use.

### Usage
Interacting with the Todo App is intuitive:

1.  **Add a New Todo:**
    *   Locate the input field at the top, labeled "Add a new todo item...".
    *   Type your task description into this field.
    *   Either click the "Add Todo" button next to the input field or press the `Enter` key on your keyboard.
    *   Your new task will appear at the bottom of the list.

2.  **Mark as Complete / Incomplete:**
    *   To toggle the completion status of a task, simply click on the text of the todo item itself.
    *   Completed tasks will show a strikethrough text and a slightly altered background color, indicating their finished status. Clicking again will revert its status.

3.  **Delete a Todo:**
    *   Each todo item has a "Delete" button positioned on its right side.
    *   Click this "Delete" button to permanently remove the task from your list.

All actions (adding, marking complete, deleting) are automatically saved to your browser's local storage, so your todo list will be preserved across browser sessions.
